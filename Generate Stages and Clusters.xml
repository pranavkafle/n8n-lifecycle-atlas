  <lifecycle_stages>
    Awareness - Grabbing attention and making first impressions with compelling content
    Engagement - Building relationships and deeper connections with the audience
    Consideration - Helping prospects evaluate options and understand value
    Activation and Conversion - Moving prospects toward commitment and purchase
    Onboarding - Ensuring smooth first experiences and building confidence
    Retention - Keeping existing customers engaged and satisfied
    Loyalty and Advocacy - Rewarding and empowering best customers
    Reactivation and Win-back - Re-engaging customers who have drifted away
  </lifecycle_stages>

  <guidelines>
    - Use ALL programs to map to appropriate lifecycle stages
    - Create clusters based on common themes, purposes, or target audiences. Create as many clusters as make sense based on data â€” no fixed limit.
    - Group programs that serve similar purposes or target similar customer segments
    - For each cluster, provide a brief description of what it contains
    - If a stage has no relevant programs, use "No programs mapped to this stage" as the cluster description
    - Awareness stage typically happens outside Customer.io - only include if programs clearly belong here and nowhere else.
    - Output ONLY the tree structure - no introductions, or conclusions
  </guidelines>
