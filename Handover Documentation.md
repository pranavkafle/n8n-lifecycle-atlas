## üîç **1. Overview & Objectives**

### **What is the Lifecycle Atlas?**

The Lifecycle Atlas is an AI-powered automation tool that analyzes Customer.io workspace data to automatically generate:
- **Customer Journey Maps** - Visual representation of all campaigns, newsletters, and transactional messages
- **Lifecycle Stage Categorization** - Automatic grouping into 8 lifecycle stages
- **Campaign Clustering** - Smart grouping of similar campaigns within each stage
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Miro mindmaps and Google Sheets analysis

### **Problem Being Solved**

CSMs spend hours manually reviewing customer workspaces to understand:
- What campaigns are running
- How they map to the customer lifecycle
- Where gaps exist in the customer journey
- Which campaigns serve similar purposes

This tool automates that analysis from hours to minutes.

### **Target Users**

- **Primary:** Customer Success Managers (CSMs)
- **Secondary:** Solution Architects, Technical Account Managers
- **Technical Level Required:** Basic (can follow instructions, no coding needed)

### **Success Metrics**

‚úÖ **Success looks like:**
- CSMs are creating journey maps automatically
- Using maps to have strategic conversations with customers
- Identifying gaps and opportunities for campaign optimization
- Driving actionable outcomes from the analysis
- Analysis completed in <10minutes (vs.¬†2-4 weeks manually)

## üì• **3. Input Requirements**

### **Data Source: Customer.io Workspace Export**

The workflow requires a JSON export from Customer.io containing:
- **Campaigns** (with states: running, paused, stopped, archived)
- **Newsletters**
- **Transactional Messages**
- **Message metadata** (subjects, types, IDs)

### **Data Collection Process**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT COMPLIANCE STEPS:**

1. **Generate Export URL:**
    
    ```
    https://[datacenter].fly.customer.io/v1/environments/[env_id]/deliveries/filters
    ```
    
    Where:
    
    - `[datacenter]` = ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúeu‚Äù
    - `[env_id]` = Customer‚Äôs environment ID
    - **Requirement:** Must have read access to customer‚Äôs workspace
2. **Download & Upload Process:**
    - Click the generated link
    - Download JSON file to your computer
    - **Save it locally** (required for upload)
    - Upload to n8n form
    - **DELETE the file from your computer immediately** (compliance requirement)
3. **Required JSON Structure:**
    
    ```json
    {  "campaigns": [    {      "id": 123,      "name": "Welcome Series",      "state": "running"    }  ],  "newsletters": [...],  "transactional_messages": [...],  "messages": [...],  "branch_messages": [...]}
    ```
    

‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues with Large Files:**
- Processing is slower for bigger workspaces
- Very large files might timeout or fail
- If it fails, **wait a few hours and retry**
- No formal stress testing completed yet

### **Data Preparation Requirements**

‚úÖ **No manual preparation needed** - The workflow handles everything:
- Filtering out archived/draft campaigns
- Deduplicating messages
- Cleaning null/undefined fields
- Normalizing data structure
- All cleaning happens automatically

‚ö†Ô∏è **Compliance Requirement:** Users MUST delete the downloaded JSON file after upload

---

## ü§ñ **4. AI Workflow & Prompt Strategy**

### **AI Tools Configuration**

**Single AI Tool:** Google Gemini (via Google Cloud)
- **Models Used:** Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite & Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Purpose:** Standardized output for all analyses
- **Temperature:** Default (0.7)
- **Max Retries:** 5 attempts with 5-second delays
- **Prompts:** Embedded within n8n workflow (also available in GitHub)

### **Two-Stage AI Analysis**

### **Stage 1: Cluster Generation**

**Prompt File:** `Generate Stages and Clusters.xml`

**Purpose:** Analyze all programs to create lifecycle stage structure

**Key Prompt Elements:**

```xml
<role>
  You are a senior lifecycle marketing strategist analyzing messaging data
  to identify lifecycle stages and campaign clusters.
</role>
<lifecycle_stages>
  Awareness - Grabbing attention and making first impressions
  Engagement - Building relationships and deeper connections
  Consideration - Helping prospects evaluate options
  Activation and Conversion - Moving prospects toward commitment
  Onboarding - Ensuring smooth first experiences
  Retention - Keeping existing customers engaged
  Loyalty and Advocacy - Rewarding best customers
  Reactivation and Win-back - Re-engaging drifted customers
</lifecycle_stages>
```

**Expected Output Format:**

```
Stage: Onboarding
Programs focused on welcoming new users and initial setup:

Clusters:
Welcome Series:
Automated emails sent immediately after signup
Product Setup:
Guides for initial configuration and integration
```

### **Stage 2: Individual Program Categorization**

**Prompt File:** `Message a model.xml`

**Purpose:** Categorize each program into the generated clusters

**Key Prompt Elements:**

```xml
<output_format>
  Output ONLY the categorization in this exact JSON format:
  {
    "program_name": "[Program Name]",
    "program_type": "[Campaign|Newsletter|Transactional]",
    "program_id": "[ID]",
    "lifecycle_stage": "[Stage Name]",
    "cluster": "[Cluster Name]",
    "reasoning": "[One line explanation]"
  }
</output_format>
```

### **Key Innovation: Individual Program Processing**

**Why it works:**
- Each program is sent to Gemini individually (one at a time)
- This eliminates hallucination issues
- Ensures consistent categorization
- Creates standardized output across all analyses

### **Output Standardization**

‚úÖ **Every analysis looks identical:**
- Same structure
- Same format
- Same visualization
- No variation between customers

**Manual Refinement:** If needed, refinements are done directly in Miro after generation

### **Handling AI Responses**

The workflow includes automatic:
- JSON extraction from responses
- Error handling for malformed JSON
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Cleaning of markdown artifacts
- Validation and iteration through code

### **Deliverable 2: Miro Visual Mindmap**

**Location:** Company Miro dashboard (CSMs added as co-owners)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Initial Display Issue**
When first created, the mindmap will appear **messy and overlapped**. This is normal! 

**Required Manual Fix:**
1. Open the Miro board
2. Select the central node
3. Click change theme and select horizontal or vertical button to trigger auto-layout.
4. Manually drag nodes to position:
- Center node in the middle
- Drag some branches left, some right
- Creates balanced visualization

[CleanShot 2025-09-17 at 14.45.47.mp4](attachment:00df3e5c-85cd-49dd-acd3-0572aaf0efe2:CleanShot_2025-09-17_at_14.45.47.mp4)

**Why this happens:**
- Cannot control X/Y axis programmatically in Miro
- All nodes initially stack on the right side
- Manual adjustment takes 30 seconds.

**Final Structure (after manual fix):**

```
[Company Name] Lifecycle Atlas (86)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Onboarding (15)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Welcome Series (8)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Campaigns (5)
